My ability to write well is directly correlated with how frequently I ~~write~~ hit "publish."

One of the ~~reasons~~ excuses that I haven't been writing frequently is because I didn't have a place to write. So I have decided to spin up a [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org) site and start writing again.

As an added bonus, I get to play with VuePress to see if I want to use it for our [ResaleAI](https://resaleai.com) documentation. Or maybe even our website!
